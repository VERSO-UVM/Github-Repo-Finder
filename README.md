# Repository Finder

## Overview
Repository Finder is a tool that identifies and analyzes open-source repositories affiliated with universities using GitHub metadata and contributor analysis. The pipeline is split into four modular scripts:

- **main_scraping.py**: Fetches and stores raw repository, organization, and contributor data.

- **main_filtering.py**: Filters repositories based on affiliation with a specific university.

- **main_analysis.py**: Analyzes and visualizes filtered repository data, including license usage, language distribution, and community practices.

- **main_analysis_combined.py**: Analyzes and visualizes aggregated repository data by type. We use this script to analyze the data of the 10 University of California campuses.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up GitHub API access:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
     ```
     GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_token  # Optional: only needed for LLM-based models
     ```

## Scraping 

This step collects raw data from GitHub, including repositories, organizations, contributor activity, and extended metadata (e.g., README, license, templates). All data is stored in a structured SQLite database located in:
```
Data/db/repository_data_{ACRONYM}_database.db
```

There are already configuration files available for ten universities from the University of California System:
- UCB (University of California, Berkeley)  
- UCD (University of California, Davis)  
- UCI (University of California, Irvine)  
- UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles)  
- UCM (University of California, Merced)  
- UCR (University of California, Riverside)  
- UCSD (University of California, San Diego)  
- UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara)  
- UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz)  
- UCSF (University of California, San Francisco)

For a simple test case, replace `university_acronyms = ['UCSD']` in `repofinder/main_scraping.py` with the acronym of the university you would like to collect data from.

For any other university, create a configuration file inside the config folder and update the path accordingly.


Run the scraping script:
```sh
python repofinder/main_scraping.py
```


It will execute the following steps:
1. **Repository Finder:** Generates a JSON file with repositories based on a configuration file.
2. **Database Creation:** Reads the JSON file and creates a database.
3. **Organization Data Collection:** Gathers organization metadata.
4. **Repository Collection from Organizations:** Finds repositories owned by discovered organizations.
5. **User Data Collection:** Identifies users affiliated with the university.
6. **Repository Collection from Users:** Finds repositories owned by discovered users.
7. **Extra Features Extraction:** Retrieves extra features that are not collected by default (includes release downloads, readme, code of conduct, contributing, security policy, issue templates, pull request template, subscribers count).
8. **Contributor Data Collection:** Fetches contributor details for repositories.

Note: Execution times vary based on the number of repositories and API rate limits. You can selectively comment out steps in `main_scraping.py` to run only specific parts of the pipeline.

## Filtering
This step filters repositories in two stages: (1) identifying whether a repository is affiliated with a university and (2) classifying the type of project (DEV, EDU, DATA, DOCS, WEB, OTHER). Both tasks are handled in the `main_filtering.py` script.

1. Score-based classification, which applies a set of heuristic rules over repository and contributor metadata.
2. Supervised machine learning models using embedding models.
3. Large Language Model (LLM) classification using OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo).

There are manual labels and test sets for UCSB, UCSC and UCSD so you can use all classification methods for these three universities.

If you want to classify repositories for another university, provide a file named `{ACRONYM}_Random200.csv` with the columns `html_url` and `manual_label` in the following directory: 
     ```
  Data/manual_labels/{ACRONYM}_Random200.csv
     ```

Additionally, for ROC curve generation, you will need to provide a test set under:
     ```
  Data/test_data/test_set_{ACRONYM}.csv
     ```

For the type classification pipeline, we only use language models so no manual labels are required. However, to compute the accuracy of the classification, you will need to provide a test set under:
     ```
  Data/test_data/type_test_set_{ACRONYM}.csv
     ```

Project type test sets are provided for UCSB, UCSC and UCSD. 

Run the filtering script:
```sh
python repofinder/main_filtering.py
```

You can selectively comment out models in `main_filtering.py` to run only specific methods. This script generates prediction CSV files for each method (score-based, machine learning, and LLMs) in the `results/{ACRONYM}/` folder.

## Analysis
This step generates visual summaries and evaluation metrics based on the filtered repository data per university. It includes:

1. Language distribution 
2. License usage patterns
3. Adoption of best-practice repository features (e.g., README, security policy, issue templates)


Run the analysis script:
```sh
python repofinder/main_analysis.py
```

All plots are saved in the `plots/combined/` directory.

## Combined Type Analysis
This step generates visual summaries and evaluation metrics using filtered aggregated repository data. The script focuses on analyzing project characteristics by type and popularity.

It includes:

1. **Language distribution by project type**
2. **License usage patterns by project type**
3. **Adoption of best-practice repository features** (e.g., README, license, citation, issue templates)
4. **Project type distribution** across all affiliated repositories
5. **Feature heatmap by star buckets for DEV projects** — shows the presence of best practices in projects grouped by their GitHub star count
6. **Scatterplot of feature presence by stars** — visualizes how feature usage varies across individual projects based on their popularity

Run the combined analysis script:
```sh
python repofinder/main_analysis_combined.py
```

All plots are saved in the `plots/combined/` directory.

## Local Web Dashboard

A self-contained HTML dashboard can be generated from any scraped database. It requires no server — the output is a single HTML file that opens directly in your browser.

Run the dashboard generator after scraping:
```sh
python dashboard.py [ACRONYM]
```

For example:
```sh
python dashboard.py UVM
```

This reads `Data/db/repository_data_{ACRONYM}_database.db`, generates `dashboard_{ACRONYM}.html`, and opens it automatically in your browser.

The dashboard includes:
- **Summary stats** — total repositories, stars, forks, and unique languages
- **Language distribution** — doughnut chart of primary languages used
- **License distribution** — doughnut chart of license types
- **Community feature adoption** — horizontal bar chart showing the percentage of repositories with a README, license, code of conduct, contributing guide, security policy, issue templates, and PR template
- **Star count histogram** — distribution of repositories by star count
- **Repository explorer** — searchable, sortable table of up to 500 repositories with per-repo feature badges
